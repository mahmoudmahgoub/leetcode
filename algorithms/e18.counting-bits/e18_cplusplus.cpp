/*
If the number is even, the number of 1s is equal to the number which is half of it.
That is because number i is just left shift by 1 bit from number i / 2.
Therefore, they should have the same number of 1 bits.
If the numbers are odd, e.g. 1, 3, 5, 7.
The number of 1 bits is equal to the number (i - 1) + 1.

x  = (1001011101)_2 =(605)_10
x' = (100101110)_2 = (302)_10
We can see that x' is differ than x by one bit, because x'
can be considered as the result of removing the least significant bit of x.
